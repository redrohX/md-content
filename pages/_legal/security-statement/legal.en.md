Minddistrict is a leader in e-health solutions. Thousands of institutes and care-providers have entrusted Minddistrict with data in our e-health platforms and make use of our services. Because many of our customers provide medical care, we take our customers and their clients security and privacy concerns very seriously.

We strive to ensure that user data is handled securely and in line with the relevant and strict regulations on privacy. Minddistrict uses advanced technology and other measures to ensure a level of security that is appropriate and commercially available today. This Security Statement is aimed at being transparent about our security infrastructure and practices, to help reassure you that your data is appropriately protected. We review and amend security and policies of Minddistrict on periodic basis. In our privacy policy you may find more information on handling of personal data of clients in our platform.

<strong>User Security</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> User data on our database is logically segregated by account-based access rules. User accounts have unique usernames and passwords that must be entered each time a user logs on. Minddistrict issues a session cookie only to record encrypted authentication information for the duration of a specific session. The session cookie does not include the password of the user.</li>
 	<li><strong>Passwords:</strong> User application passwords have minimum complexity requirements and such as use of a minimum number of characters (12) and special characters. Passwords are stored encrypted.</li>
 	<li><strong>Single Sign-On:</strong> For certain customers Minddistrict supports access-control to solutions of Minddistrict for their organization.</li>
 	<li><strong>Data Portability and Preservation:</strong> Minddistrict enables customers to export your data from our system, following a procedure to prevent misuse or unauthorized distribution. Also we store data or use it with other applications.</li>

 	<li><strong>Data Residency:</strong> All Minddistrict user data, is stored on servers located in secure databases in the European European Economic Community (EEC). The EEC requires a very high level of privacy. For customers in the United Kingdom all personal data of clients is stored on a separate location in the United Kingdom. Only certain production servers contain personal data of end- users, whereas development servers do not contain personal data. We store our office data and the corporate website of Minddistrict on a separate (physical and logical) location, apart from our production environment.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Physical Security</strong>

The Minddistrict solutions and production environment are stored in heavily secured data centers. These data centers include all the necessary physical security controls you would expect in a data center these days (24Ã—7 monitoring, cameras, visitor logs, entry requirements). Our hosting party has certifications for ISO 27001:2013, ISAE 3402 Type II, NEN 7510 and ISO 14001. For more information, visit Intermax.

 	<li><strong>Firewalls:</strong> Minddistrict uses a multilayered firewall solution to restrict access to permitted users and controlled processes.</li>
 	<li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Access of staff to our app requires two-factor authentication, and role-based access is applied to ensure only authorized staff is allowed to certain environments or data.</li>
 	<li><strong>Logging and Auditing:</strong> Central logging systems capture and archive internal systems accessincluding authentication attempts.</li>
 	<li><strong>Encryption in Transit:</strong> By default, Minddistrict has Transport Layer Security (TLS) enabled to encrypt traffic between you and our e-health platform. All communications with our domains (minddistrict.com, mindistrict.co.uk and Minddistrict.de) are sent over TLS connections, which protects communications by using both server authentication and data encryption. This ensures that user data in transit is safe, secure, and available only to intended recipients. We strive to maintain the highest possible rating on SSL tests.</li>

<strong>Handling of Security Breaches</strong>

Despite best efforts, no method of transmission over the internet and no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security. However, if Minddistrict learns of a security breach, we will notify affected customers and if necessary users so that they can take appropriate protective steps, following applicable EU legislation on privacy and data breach notification. Such notification may include providing email notices or posting a notice on our website if a breach occurs.

<strong>Your Responsibilities</strong>

Keeping data secure cannot be done by Minddistrict alone. Security depends all parties, including both customers and all clients. They also need to maintain the security of their accounts by responsible use of passwords and use of our solutions in safe environments. Please update your devices and software to keep up with industry standards, as this is known to reduce the risk of being compromised. Customers should also ensure that they have sufficient security by using an information management security system and take appropriate measures to maintain a sufficient level of security for the data involved.

Upon request we can offer advice regarding the use of our solutions, but it is your responsibility as data controller, and/or in your best interest as data subject, to ensure that your data is processed in a safe, responsible and legitimate manner.
